# Brute Force kNN
 This is a basic implementation of brute-force kNN which was developed for fun.
 
 - Sample case can be enhanced by using LDA since images are data instances with large number of features.
 - Class is very lightweight and does not contain any performance metric. 
 - Only the Minkowski and Eucledian Distance metrics are implemented.
